## Creating Database Migrations
Example of creating an InitialCreate migration. Run this the ```/src/Api``` directory.
connection string must be configured in the appsettings.json or appsettings.development.json file that your environment is pointing too. 
If you see an error similar to this: ```Format of the initialization string does not conform to specification starting at index 0```
This is an indication that there is a configuration issue during ef miggrations. First place to check is appsettings.
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --output-dir ../Infrastructure/Data/Migrations --project ../Infrastructure/Mskcc.Tools.Idp.ConnectionsAggregator.Infrastructure.csproj
```

### üîë How to Create a Client Credentials Flow in Postman to Get a JWT Access Token
To use the these endpoints, you need to obtain a JWT access token using the client credentials flow. Here‚Äôs how you can do it in Postman:

1. **Open Postman** and create a new request.

2. **Set the Request Type** to `POST`.

3. **Enter the Token Endpoint URL**:
   - URL: `https://your-pingfederate-server.com/as/token.oauth2`

4. **Set the Headers**:
   - Key: `Content-Type`
   - Value: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

5. **Set the Body**:
   - Select `x-www-form-urlencoded` as the body type.
   - Add the following key-value pairs:
     - `grant_type`: `client_credentials`
     - `client_id`: `your-client-id`
     - `client_secret`: `your-client-secret`
     - `scope`: `your-scope` (if required)

6. **Send the Request**:
   - Click on the `Send` button to send the request.

7. **Retrieve the Access Token**:
   - In the response, you will receive a JSON object containing the access token. Copy the value of the `access_token` field.

8. **Use the Access Token in Subsequent Requests**:
   - For subsequent requests to the Ping Federate endpoints, add the following header:
     - Key: `Authorization`
     - Value: `Bearer your-access-token`

### ‚ö° Pagination Support

Both the **SAML** and **OIDC** connections endpoints support pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. You can control the number of records returned by specifying the **`pageNumber`** and **`pageSize`** as query parameters in your GET requests.

#### Pagination Parameters:
- **`pageNumber`** (optional): The page number for pagination. Default is `0` to indicate no pagination options requested.
- **`pageSize`** (optional): The number of records per page. Default is `0` to indicate no pagination options requested.

### Example Request:

```http
GET /api/v1/pingfederate/oidc/connections?pageNumber=2&pageSize=5
```

This request would retrieve the **OIDC connections** on **page 2**, with **5 connections per page**.

### How Pagination Works:

In the API implementation, pagination is handled by the `GetOidcConnections` method, which processes the `pageNumber` and `pageSize` query parameters. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Default Values**: If either `pageNumber` or `pageSize` is not provided, the API returns all connections without pagination.
   
2. **Pagination Logic**: When both `pageNumber` and `pageSize` are specified:
   - The API skips records based on the formula:  
     `Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)`  
     This skips the number of records before the current page.
   - The `Take(pageSize)` method limits the results to the specified page size.

3. **Paged Response**: If pagination is enabled in the app configuration, a **paged response** is returned. This response includes:
   - The data for the current page.
   - The current page number and page size.
   - Total records available (if applicable).

Example response (with pagination enabled):

```json
{
  "data": [ /* Array of OIDC connection objects */ ],
  "pageNumber": 2,
  "pageSize": 5,
  "totalRecords": 50
}
```

If pagination is not needed, the response will simply return all the records as usual.

## üìà Monitoring & Dashboards

### üöÄ Hangfire Dashboard

The Hangfire dashboard provides a real-time overview of your background jobs, including scheduled, recurring, and completed jobs. You can access it at:

- **URL**: `/hangfire`

Here is the updated version of the notes with an explanation about Swagger's deprecation in .NET 9 due to a lack of community support:

---

### üìä Scalar API Documentation UI

Scalar UI API documentation is available in **development mode** to interact with the API endpoints. It provides an interactive interface where you can test all API routes directly.

Scalar UI offers similar functionality to Swagger, allowing you to document and test your API endpoints interactively without relying on Swagger‚Äôs tooling. It integrates seamlessly with the OpenAPI specification and provides a modern, feature-rich API documentation experience.

- **URL**: `/scalar/v1`


#### üö® Important Notes about Swagger in .NET 9:

- **Swagger Deprecation in .NET 9**: 
  In .NET 9, **Swagger** has been officially deprecated due to a lack of community support and limited updates. This change primarily affects the use of Swagger UI for generating and interacting with OpenAPI documentation. 

---

This should provide a clear understanding of why Swagger is no longer the recommended tool in .NET 9 and how Scalar is a viable alternative for API documentation and testing.
